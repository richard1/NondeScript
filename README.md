NondeScript
===========

A collection of some scripts I wrote.  Most of these are pretty simple and straightforward.  This work is provided "as is", so feel free to use any part of it.

* **timer** - a countdown timer that pops up a notification message of your choice when time's up.

* **pickforme** - feed it a list of several shows or movies that you're stuck on choosing between, and let it "calculate" and "analyze" which show you should watch.
