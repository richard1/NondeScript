NondeScript
===========

<i><b>nondescript</b> (adj.) - "lacking distinctive or interesting features or characteristics"</i>

<br />

A collection of some scripts I wrote.  Most of these are pretty simple and straightforward, mostly written for fun or to implement a basic feature.  This work is provided "as is", so feel free to use any part of these.

* **timer** - a countdown timer that pops up a notification message of your choice when time's up, and plays a Ubuntu notification sound (might need to install the <a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=sox">sox</a> package).

* **pickforme** - feed it a list of several shows or movies that you're stuck on choosing between, and let it "calculate" and "analyze" which show you should watch.

<i><b>Fun fact</b>: nonde </i>(飲んで)<i> means "drinking" in Japanese!</i>
