NondeScript
===========

<i><b>nondescript</b> (adj.) - "lacking distinctive or interesting features or characteristics"</i>

<br />

A collection of some scripts I wrote.  Most of these are pretty simple and straightforward, mostly written for fun or to implement a basic feature.  This work is provided "as is", so feel free to use any part of these.

* **timer** - a countdown timer that pops up a notification message of your choice when time's up, and plays a Ubuntu notification sound (might need to install the <a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=sox">sox</a> package).

* **pickforme** - feed it a list of several shows or movies that you're stuck on choosing between, and let it "calculate" and "analyze" which show you should watch.

* **weather** - grabs the current temperature and weather conditions in La Jolla, CA.  Perhaps this will incorporate your location in the future.  Also spits out the current battery level as a percentage (why would anyone do this?  good question).

* **jackd** - automatically mutes the system audio when it detects that the headphone jack has been unplugged, intended to be run as a background process on system startup.  Tested using Ubuntu 14.04.

<i><b>Fun fact</b>: nonde </i>(飲んで)<i> means "drinking" in Japanese!</i>
